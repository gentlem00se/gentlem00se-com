Somehow, you’ve found the digital home of gentlem00se — part blog, part lab, part loosely controlled experiment in curiosity.

This site is a personal blog and project space for sharing thoughts, tutorials, and creative work. 

Not that I talk about my employer much (or at all) on here, but my views don't represent my employer etc etc.

**Who am I?**

gentlem00se is the online moniker of professional product security engineer [Chase Davies](https://github.com/chasepd) for security related stuff.


**Why gentlem00se?**

......why not gentlem00se?
