Somehow, you’ve found the digital home of gentlem00se — part blog, part lab, part loosely controlled experiment in curiosity.

This site is a personal blog and project space for sharing thoughts, tutorials, and creative work. 

Not that I talk about my employer much (or at all) on here, but my views don't represent my employer etc etc.

**Who am I?**

I'm a developer, security engineer, tinkerer, and digital explorer passionate about technology, AI, hardware, making the world a good place for everyone, and learning new things. This site is where I share what I discover, build, and enjoy.

I hope you enjoy the content, and thanks for visiting! 

**Who are you really though?**

I'm the guy who uses the moniker gentlem00se. I'm a human being living on the planet Earth. I am definitely not an alien, robot, or hologram.


**Why gentlem00se?**
